There are 'n' number of stones, each one with a value in it. A player starts by taking a step to the first stone. There are three options for the player, 
1) He may step on the next stone(stone 2), which gives him the value of the stone he lands on.
2) He may hop skipping a stone to stone 3, which gives him twice the value of the stone he lands on
3) He may do a double hop to stone 4, which gives him thrice the value of the stone he lands on (This can be used only once)
The challenge for the player is to find the maximum score he can get.
